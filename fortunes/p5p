(12:00:06 PM) Alias: For some reason, despite knowing we were talking about
deprecation I thought "Holy shit that's evil, don't add that feature!"

Rather than fix perldiag, I just removed the LOOOOOOOOONG deprecated
"feature".  How long?  October 17, 1994.  That's right, its a perl 4
feature that was deprecated in 5.000.  I think 15 years is long enough
for everyone to get the memo.

You need to get your technical debt paid off, before the pumpking
suddenly and accidentally calls it in, and bankrupts you.
