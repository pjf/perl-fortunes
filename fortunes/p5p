(12:00:06 PM) Alias: For some reason, despite knowing we were talking about
deprecation I thought "Holy shit that's evil, don't add that feature!"

Rather than fix perldiag, I just removed the LOOOOOOOOONG deprecated
"feature".  How long?  October 17, 1994.  That's right, its a perl 4
feature that was deprecated in 5.000.  I think 15 years is long enough
for everyone to get the memo.
