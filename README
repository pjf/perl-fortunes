All these files are in unix fortune format.  That means each fortune
lines with a percent on a line by itself.

If you've been quoted in a fortune, and don't like it, let me know
and I'll remove you.

To add new fortunes, fork the repo off github, and send me a pull
request.  Or send patches/suggestions to
(pjf+fortunes at perltraining.com.au)
